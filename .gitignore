Data/*.rxdata

# The PluginScripts.rxdata file is generated by a different compiler.
# Thus, serializing it to yaml is completely unnecessary.
# However, in the case where it accidentally gets serialized to yaml, we will
# avoid git tracking it (below). This avoids thousands of lines of base64 binary-encoding
# that simply restate the existing script files found in the Plugins/ folder
Data/YAML/PluginScripts.yaml


# One major exception - we will continue to include Scripts.rxdata
# The reason is that the unpackd.exe will directly check for this file
# and refuse to generate a new file. It will only edit an existing file (to ensure that
# backups are stored correctly)
!Data/Scripts.rxdata

# unpackd.exe keeps backups of the old binaries, just in case, but we won't track these backups.
