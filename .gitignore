# One major exception - we will continue to include Scripts.rxdata
# The reason is that the unpackd.exe will directly check for this file
# and refuse to generate a new file. It will only edit an existing file (to ensure that
# backups are stored correctly)

# unpackd.exe keeps backups of the old binaries, just in case, but we won't track these backups.
